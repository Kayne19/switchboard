# Task for problem-framer

Turn the caller report into a precise bug contract and acceptance criteria. The two reported failures are: (1) one utterance can produce two simultaneous audio streams, where pausing the visible player leaves another stream playing; (2) seeking/skipping a clip to its end must consume that clip and advance exactly once to the next queued clip, but currently the same clip restarts. Identify invariants around one active playback owner, pause/cleanup, queue consumption, ended/seek events, and duplicate event handling. Read docs/concurrency-and-test-hazards.md before making assumptions. Do not edit code.

**Output:**
Return the complete artifact in your final response.
The runtime will persist it to exactly this path: /home/kayne19/projects/switchboard/.pi-workflow/outputs/wf_1785999378987544477_3719023_0/define.md
Do not call contact_supervisor merely because no write-capable tool is available.
This path is authoritative for this run.
Ignore any other output filename or output path mentioned elsewhere, including output destinations in the base agent prompt, system prompt, or task instructions.

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: attested
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Return concrete findings with file paths and severity when applicable

Required evidence: review-findings, residual-risks

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
`criteriaSatisfied[].status` must be exactly one of: satisfied, not-satisfied, not-applicable.
`commandsRun[].result` must be exactly one of: passed, failed, not-run.
`manualNotes` and `notes` are optional strings; an empty string means no note and does not satisfy `manual-notes` evidence.
